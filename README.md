# Database Modeling Project

Welcome to the Database Modeling Project! This project focuses on designing and implementing an efficient relational database by analyzing wireframes and UI design of a specific application. The primary goal is to ensure that the database is in Third Normal Form (3NF) to optimize data integrity and minimize redundancy.

## Introduction
In this project, the database design process is driven by a thorough analysis of wireframes and UI designs of a specific application. The goal is to create a robust and efficient database schema that aligns with the application's requirements and ensures optimal performance.

## Project Overview
The project involves the following key steps:
1. **Requirement Analysis**: Understanding the data requirements based on the wireframes and UI design of the application.
2. **Database Schema Design**: Creating an initial database schema, identifying tables, relationships, and attributes.
3. **Normalization (3NF)**: Ensuring that the database design is in Third Normal Form to eliminate data redundancy and dependencies.
4. **Implementation**: Translating the designed schema into a working database, using an appropriate database management system.

## Database Design
The database design is a critical aspect of this project. It includes:
- Identification of entities and their relationships.
- Definition of attributes for each entity.
- Establishment of primary keys and foreign keys to enforce referential integrity.

## Normalization (3NF)
To achieve an efficient and well-organized database, the design adheres to Third Normal Form (3NF). This normalization process involves removing transitive dependencies and ensuring that data is stored in a way that minimizes redundancy while maintaining referential integrity.

## Usage
This repository is primarily for documenting the database design process. If you are working on a similar project or interested in learning about efficient database modeling, feel free to explore the documentation and SQL scripts.

Happy database modeling!
